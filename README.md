# JOBS YOU APPLIED

This software will be developed using PyQt5.

## The idea:
_The idea is pretty simple!_

- Using _sqlite3_ as the database for a start, if I see that it's becoming little laggy for sqlite3, I'll change the database to MySQL.

- 2 Tables will be there
    - **Applications** - Will store all applications with company website, job details, applied from website and resume id (this will be the reference key to the table Resume_Files).

    - **Resume_Files** - BLOB as resume file, the file path and the first resume file registered date.
